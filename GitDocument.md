	Git Document tutorial

   1-Definition

	Git has three main states that your files can reside in: 
	1-modified:  means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
    2-staged:    means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot
    3-committed  :  means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

    By this definitions:  we have  3 sections of git project
    1-the working tree: is a single checkout of one version of the project  =>  These files are pulled out of the
						  compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
    2- the staging area:  These files are pulled out of the  compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
    3-Git directory:  the place where stored data for your project, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another  computer.



2- configuration

git config:
Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration variables that control
all aspects of how Git looks and operates

To view all setting and where  they are coming from using:
        git config --list --show-origin

   Set your email and  your  name :
  
  $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
  $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

  configure an  text editor 

     when git needs you to type a message, If you want to use a different text editor, such as Emacs, you can do the following:

  $ git config --global core.editor emacs
  $ git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"

  Branche name:
   by default,Git will create a branch named, master when you create repository with git init, but you can set you propre name if you whant, by using this commande:

   $ git config --global init.defaultBranch main   // here we set main a default branch name instead of master branch name.



   check you Settings:
       git config --list    this command check all setting of you git 

    Check specific key  :
     git config user.name

     Need Help:
       the are three, equivalent way to get a help for any Git command:

       git help <verb>
       git <verb> --help
       man git-<verb>  

       For example , to get a help for  : git config

         git  help config.

 /*****************************   chap 2: Basic Git **************************************/

    To start a new project  form scratch use this command :

    °°°°°°° git  init

    After adding a file that you are working with  you can track this file by this commad
        git add  *.c  // this is track aff files this extension *.c
        git  add LICENCE
        git commit  -m 'here you put you owner message'

    Clone an existing project:
     For all most time you will  working with existing project  in this case you must get this project by clone this one:

   °°°°°°°° git clone url_to_project

       example :  git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
         this command create a directory  named  libgit2 and intialize a .git  directory inside it

  °°°°°° different protocole transfre given by git.
  HTTP, or SSH

  °°°°°°°°Recording Changes to the Repository
   a file can be tracked or untracked.

   to check the  file status in git is by using this command:

       git status
   
   In order to begin tracked a new file, use this command:
       git add. 


     Staging  Modified  Files

     let assume that we have a tracked file test.md
      if you do same modification on it you must to stage this file by using the same comman to add untracked file:

       git add    is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin :
                  racking new files, 
                  to stage files,
                  and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved

                  It may be helpful to think of it  more as “add precisely this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to the project”          

    Short status


    the commande git status i quit wordy , you can use this command is more short  

    git status  --short


    Example:

     git status -s
			 M README           M  for  modified file
			MM Rakefile         MM modified staged an modified again so there are changes to it that are both staged and unstaged
			A lib/git.rb        A  for new files that have been added to the staging  area
			?? LICENSE.txt      ??  for  New files that aren’t tracked

    Ignoring Files

    There is same file that you wan to untrack for exampl: file generated by your systems, log files ....Etc
     in this case  use thoses commands:

     cat .gitignore  // to show this files

      *.[oa]   => this tell to git to ignore all files ending with .o or .a
      *~       => any files that's end with tilde

      Setting up this files  for you repository is the good idea befor to starte 

      // see in internet pattern to ignore files



    Commit your change
       after finishing working , you can know  commit your work

        git commit

        Doing so launches your editor of choice, you can change by doing 
        you want using this command you just show befor :

               git config  --global core.editor   (ligne 37 de ce document)

        or classic command:
         git commit -m 'put you message here'       

         When you commit git produce : SHA-1  checksum

    Skipping the Staging Area

          git commit -a -m 'message of your commit'   this command skip the staging area


    Remove file:
    To remove file from git you have to remove it from your tracked files and then commit

    the command is 
     git rm file.txt
      and commit next time
      the file will be gone and no longer tracked 

    Another useful thing you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore 
     to do this:
     git rm --cached README  

     You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns  for example : git rm log/\*.log
